# Iterate String using while loop
# By looping through the string using while loop, we can do lots of string operations. Let us see some of the examples.

# Example: while loop to iterate string letter by letter

name = "Jessa"
i = 0
res = len(name) - 1
while i <= res:
    print(name[i])
    i = i + 1
