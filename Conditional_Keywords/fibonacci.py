# Have you ever wondered about the Fibonacci Sequence?
# It’s a series of numbers in which the next number is found by adding
# up the two numbers before it. The first two numbers are 0 and 1.

# For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. The next number
# in this series is 13 + 21 = 34.

# first two numbers
num1, num2 = 0, 1

print("Fibonacci sequence:")
# run loop 10 times
for i in range(10):
    # print next number of a series
    print(num1, end="  ")
    # add last two numbers to get next number
    res = num1 + num2

    # update values
    num1 = num2
    num2 = res
