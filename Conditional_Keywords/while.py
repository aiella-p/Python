#In Python, The while loop statement repeatedly executes a code block while a particular condition is true.
# In simple words, The while loop enables the Python program to repeat a set of operations while a particular condition is true. When the condition becomes false, execution comes out of the loop immediately, 
# and the first statement after the while loop is executed.

# count = 0
# # condition: Run loop till count is less than 3
# while count < 5:
#     print(count)
#     count = count + 1

count = 0
# number = 180
while number > 10:
    # divide number by 3
    number = number / 3
    # increase count
    count = count + 1
print('Total iteration required', count)
