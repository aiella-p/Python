#Python statement ends with the token NEWLINE character.
#  But we can extend the statement over multiple lines using line continuation character (\).
#  This is known as an explicit continuation.

#Example

addition = 10 + 20 + \
           30 + 40 + \
           50 + 60 + 70
print(addition)
# Output: 280
