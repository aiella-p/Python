# pass is a null operation. Nothing happens when it executes. 
# It is useful as a placeholder when a statement is required syntactically, 
# but no code needs to be executed.

# For example, you created a function for future releases, 
# so you donâ€™t want to write a code now. In such cases, we can use a pass statement.

# Example:

# create a function
def fun1(arg):
    pass  # a function that does nothing (yet)
