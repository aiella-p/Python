# The import statement is used to import modules. 
# We can also import individual classes from a module.

# Python has a huge list of built-in modules which we can use in our code. 
# For example, we can use the built-in module DateTime to work with date and time.

# Example: Import datetime module

import datetime
# get current datetime
now = datetime.datetime.now()
print(now)
